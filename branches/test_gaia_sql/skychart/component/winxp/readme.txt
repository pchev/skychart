WinXP is a components for Lazarus that helps you make WinXP programs
and helps you select an icon for your application.

If you want to use the XP style then place the components on any form 
or just include "WinXP" in your uses.
If you want to change the default program icon then replace "mainicon.ico"
and then run "remake.bat". After that open your project and select Run->Build All

Installation:
Open "winxpstyle.lpk" and install it. That's all :)
