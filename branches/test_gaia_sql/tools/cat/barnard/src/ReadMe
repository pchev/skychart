Description:
    This catalogue was created based on the original published catalogue
    by Barnard E.E., 1927, Carnegie Institution of Washington,
    "A photographic Atlas of selected regions of the Milky Way".
    The catalogue contains positions of 349 Barnard Objects.

    The objects with numbers from 1 to 175 are classified in the first
    Barnard catalogue (1919ApJ....49....1B); three of the objects in that
    list have been omitted here (Nos 52, 131a, and 172) because these
    objects had been listed twice.

    The objects from Barnard's second list are numbered from 201 to 370 --
    there are therefore no objects having the numbers from 176 to 200.
    Their positions were determined by Miss Calvert.

    The epoch for all positions in the original published catalogue was
    1875.0. Positions for both 1875.0 and 2000.0, the diameters and the
    notes are included in this machine-readable catalogue.

Historical Notes:
  * 25-Jun-1999: This catalogue was created by Junko Takahashi and Masatoshi
    Ohishi at the Astronomical Data Analysis Center, National Astronomical
    Observatory of Japan, based on the original published catalogue by
    Barnard E.E., 1927, Carnegie Institution of Washington,
    "A photographic Atlas of selected regions of the Milky Way."
  * 24-Jan-2001: The diameters and notes were kindly supplied by Bill Gray
    from the Pluto project (pluto@projectpluto.com)
  * 30-Jun-2008: Thanks to Mati Morel, 6 position errors in J2000 positions
    were corrected for the pairs B67/67a, B83/83a, and B117/B117a

Acknowledgments:
    Takahashi and Ohishi are grateful to Dr. Mitsuru Soma and
    Prof. Shiro Nishimura for their codes for the coordinate conversion.
    They also wish to thank all members at the Astronomical Data Center,
    National Astronomical Observatory of Japan for their cooperation.
