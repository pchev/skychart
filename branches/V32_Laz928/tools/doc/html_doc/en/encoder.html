      <p>This plugin can be used with encoder box using the Tangent protocol like 
        the Ouranos , AAM or NGC-MAX box.<br>
        It use a floating two stars alignment method based on the article by Toshimi 
        Taki in February 1989 S&amp;T.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the manufacturer information to connect the telescope 
        to the computer and power on the telescope.<br>
        Then use the main menu <a href="edoc1.html#telescope">Telescope</a> to 
        select the encoder plugin and start the interface. If you are asked to 
        change the program time to auto-refresh reply Yes. The following window 
        is displayed :</p>
      <p><img src="encoder1.gif" width="166" height="235"><br>
        For the first time use you need to provide some <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> 
        information.</p>
      <p>Click the &quot;Connect button&quot;, the light must change to green 
        and the encoder count are displayed at the top of the screen.</p>
      <p>Perform the following alignment procedure : </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you select 90 degree initialization : 
          <ul>
            <li>point the telescope vertically for an altaz mount or parallel 
              to the polar axis for an equatorial mount. It is important to understand 
              that you must not point to the real zenith or pole but to the direction 
              of your mount axis. Use of a fixed graduated circle or a stop piece 
              can be of great help, see also the discussion about the <a href="#z3">Z3</a> 
              parameter below. </li>
            <li>Click the &quot;Init 90&deg;&quot; button.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you select 0 degree initialization : 
          <ul>
            <li>point the telescope horizontally for an altaz mount or perpendicular 
              to the polar axis for an equatorial mount. The above note also apply 
              in this case.</li>
            <li>Click the &quot;Init 0&deg;&quot; button.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Point the telescope to a star, use a reticle eyepiece and enough power 
          to precisely center the star. </li>
        <li>Click the star on the chart.</li>
        <li>Select &quot;Sync current object&quot; from the &quot;Telescope&quot; 
          menu or the right mouse button menu.</li>
        <li>Repeat the procedure for a second star. Beware to choice a star with 
          enough difference along the two axis from the first star. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The position of the telescope is now displayed using equatorial and azimuthal 
        coordinates. </p>
      <p>You can now close the interface window by clicking the &quot;Hide&quot; 
        button.<br>
        Refere to the main menu <a href="edoc1.html#telescope">Telescope</a> help 
        to learn how to show the telescope position on the chart.</p>
      <p>Remember you can refine the local precision by using &quot;Sync current 
        object&quot; on a nearby star at any time, you are not limited with the 
        number of initialization stars. <br>
        The couple of star used for the part of the sky the telescope is actually 
        pointed is marked by a '*'.</p>
      <p>The Clear button delete all the stars in the initialization list and 
        return the interface in unitialized mode.<br>
        A mouse right click in the list allow to delete only one star from the 
        list. </p>
      <p>If your interface return status information this is indicated just below 
        the coordinates. </p>
      <p>You can also do the initialization without the chart by using a star 
        list even this is probably less convenient. If you really like that check 
        the &quot;Use&quot; box and select the star from the list, when this star 
        is centered in the telescope click the Align button. </p>
      <p><b>Main cause of error </b></p>
      <p>Sometime the position show on the chart is not the one you observe in 
        the telescope, there is many cause of possible error here is a short list 
        : </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Configuration error : 
          <ul>
            <li>Encoder steps number incorrectly set, principally if you gear 
              the encoder. Use a full mount rotation with a fixed remote reference 
              to count the exact number.</li>
            <li>Mount fabrication error not set. </li>
            <li>Missmatch between azimuthal and equatorial mount.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The precision for a two stars alignment is dependent of a precise 
          first direction initialization, use the Z3 parameter to correct a systematic 
          error. There is however no need for a precise polar alignment or mount 
          leveling.</li>
        <li>Unadapted reference stars, the first two alignment stars must have 
          enough difference along the two axis and be far enough in the sky.</li>
        <li>Also avoid to select an alignement star in the direction of the polar 
          axis, Polaris is good for an azimuthal mount but not for an equatorial.</li>
        <li>Missing encoder count in the interface box, this may occure if you 
          move the mount too rapidly or if the battery are low.</li>
        <li>Misidentification of a reference star.</li>
      </ul>

        <b><font size="+1">Interface configuration</font></b></p>
      <p><img src="encoder2.gif" width="166" height="235"><br>
        Select the encoder type you use, if your model is not listed consult your 
        documentation to find a compatible model, if you find none select the 
        generic Tangent model.<br>
        Set the encoder count for a full rotation for both axis.<br>
        The read interval is the amount of time that elapse between two position 
        query to the interface box. Use a smaller value for a smoother cursor 
        movement if your box accept that and if your computer as enough power. 
        Use a larger value to use less computer ressource or if your interface 
        box as a limited output rate.<br>
        Check the mount type (equatorial or Alt-Az) you use and if you prefere 
        to do the first initialization vertically or horizontally.</p>
      <p><a name="z3"></a>The mount fabrication error angle Z1, Z2, Z3 in degree 
        are the one defined in Taki article :<br>
        Z1 is the amount by which the elevation axis is offset from the perpendicular 
        to the horizontal axis.<br>
        Z2 is the pointing error of the telescope optical axis in the same plane.<br>
        Z3 can be considered a correction to the zero setting of the elevation 
        circle. </p>
      <p>Mesuring Z1 and Z2 can be a difficult task, but Z3 can be of great interest 
        to help to initialize the mount. <br>
        As an example imagine your Dobson mount as a security stop 5 degrees above 
        the horizon to avoid to flip the primary mirror. You can set Z3=5 and 
        check the initialization at 0 degree. To initialize the mount simply put 
        the telescope pipe horizontally to the security stop and click the &quot;Init 
        0&deg;&quot; button, that's all.<br>
        You can imagine the same if the stop is 15 degrees after the zenith but 
        in this case use the &quot;Init 90&deg;&quot; button.</p>
      <p>You don't need to set the observatory coordinates as this is automatically 
        done from the location defined in Cartes du Ciel.</p>
      <p>In the case of problem with the interface you can trace the protocol 
        to a file by checking &quot;Record protocol to a trace file&quot;.</p>
      <p>The last check box let you choice if you want this window always visible 
        at the top of the other.</p>
      <p><font size="+1"><b>Communication port configuration</b></font></p>
      <p><img src="encoder3.gif" width="166" height="235"><br>
        Select the serial port (COM1 to COM8) where the telescope is connected. 
        <br>
        Set other options (speed, data, parity and stop) according to the manufacturer 
        informations.<br>
        Change the timeout values only if you encounter communication problem 
        and after identifying the problem with the trace file. Do not set the 
        timeout to a value greater than the refresh rate in the preceding screen.</p>
      <p>Click the Save Setting button to keep your configuration for the next 
        run.<br>
        Also save the default options in Cartes du Ciel menu to keep your interface 
        choice.</p>
