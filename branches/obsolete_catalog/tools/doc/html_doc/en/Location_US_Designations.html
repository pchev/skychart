(GNIS) Feature Class Definitions</a></p>
            </h3>


The feature class terms and abbreviations currently consist of nine or fewer letters and were
chosen for computer search and retrieval purposes.  They do not necessarily represent
terminology for the identification of all kinds of cultural and natural features.  Although some of
the terms may agree with dictionary definitions, they represent more generalized categories. 
Some commonly used generics are listed in parentheses at the end of each entry to assist in
understanding the range of cultural and natural entities represented by the term.  Refer to the
Reference Data Base to retrieve all generics encountered in geographic names compilation.  In
most instances a example, archipelago or islands would be categorized as island.  The terms and
