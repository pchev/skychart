NAME

     zdump - time zone dumper

SYNOPSIS
     zdump [ --version ] [ -v ] [ -c [loyear,]hiyear ] [ zonename
     ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     Zdump prints the current time in each zonename named on the
     command line.

     These options are available:

     --version
          Output version information and exit.

     -v   For each zonename on the command line, print the time
          at the lowest possible time value, the time one day
          after the lowest possible time value, the times both
          one second before and exactly at each detected time
          discontinuity, the time at one day less than the
          highest possible time value, and the time at the
          highest possible time value, Each line ends with
          isdst=1 if the given time is Daylight Saving Time or
          isdst=0 otherwise.

     -c [loyear,]hiyear
          Cut off verbose output near the start of the given
          year(s).  By default, the program cuts off verbose
          output near the starts of the years -500 and 2500.

LIMITATIONS
     The -v option may not be used on systems with floating-point
     time_t values that are neither float nor double.

     Time discontinuities are found by sampling the results
     returned by localtime at twelve-hour intervals.  This works
     in all real-world cases; one can construct artificial time
     zones for which this fails.
