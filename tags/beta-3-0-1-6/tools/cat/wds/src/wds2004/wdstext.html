<br><br><h2>Introduction and Growth of the WDS</h2>

<p>The Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS), maintained by the United States 
Naval Observatory, is the world's principal database of astrometric double and 
multiple star information. The WDS Catalog contains positions (J2000), 
discoverer designations, epochs, position angles, separations, magnitudes, 
spectral types, proper motions and when available, Durchmusterung numbers and 
notes for the components of 100,626 systems based on 690,251 means. The current 
version, <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wdstext.html">available 
online</a>, is updated nightly. This catalog is one of four USNO double star 
catalogs to be included on a CD-ROM now in preparation. A brief summary and 
statistical analysis of the contents of the catalog are presented.

</p><p>The Washington Visual Double Star Catalog (WDS) is the successor to the Index
Catalogue of Visual Double Stars, 1961.0 (IDS; Jeffers &amp; van den Bos, 1963).
Three earlier double star catalogs in this century, those by Burnham (BDS; 
1906), Innes (SDS; 1927), and Aitken (ADS; 1932), each covered only a portion of
the sky. Both the IDS and the WDS cover the entire sky, and the WDS is intended 
to contain all known visual double stars for which at least one differential 
measure has been published. The WDS is continually updated as published data 
become available. Prior to this, two major updates have been published (Worley
&amp; Douglass 1984, 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997A%26AS..125..523W&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=39574b303c25125">
1997</a>). The Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) has seen numerous changes 
since the last major release of the catalog. The application of many techniques 
and considerable industry over the past few years has yielded unprecedented 
gains in both the number of systems and the number of measures, as indicated 
below.

<p>Figure 1: Growth in the number of means in the WDS since its inception in the
early 1960's. The 1984.0 and 1996.0 editions of the WDS are indicated and at the
cutoff date for the CD-ROM production.<br>

</p><p>The growth since the 1996.0 edition is due to many sources, however the most 
significant additions are:

</p><ul>

</li><li> <a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/speckle.html">CHARA speckle</a> (7,122)
</li><li> <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/ds_history.html#speckle">Washington speckle</a> (7,140)
</li><li> <a href="http://www.astro.ku.dk/%7Eerik/Tycho-2">Tycho-2</a> (12,755)

</li><li> Washington Fundamental Catalog (36,207)
</li></ul>

<p>While many thousand new systems have been added, many of these observing 
programs have resulted in a striking improvement in the number of observations 
per system, as shown below with a specific example of USNO speckle 
contributions. It is expected that with other large publications of data planned
in the future [e.g., the 
<a href="http://pegasus.astro.umass.edu/GradProg/2mass.html">
Two Micron All Sky Survey</a>, as well as the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ucac/"> USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog</a> the 
growth of the WDS will continue.

publication of USNO speckle means. The left figure illustrates a histogram of
USNO speckle means (also late 1997) binned vs. separation. The right figure
indicates the same information for the 2001.0 version of the WDS. <br>

</p><p>A comparison of the contributions of the different techniques, both in their
total number and mean separation are given <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/methvssep.txt"> 
here</a>. Those techniques with no measures listed are unique to the Delta-m
Catalog.

</p><p>Primarily of historical interest, a list of the top 25 observers (based on
the total number of measures and means) is presented 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/top_twentyfive.txt">here</a>. In this table, numbers are based
on the WDS reference code. Totals are provided for the number of means (usually,
as published --- a line of data in the WDS measurement database, each mean 
position often comes from several measures, usually increasing their accuracy).
To the extent that it is known, multiple authors participating in a distinct 
group or project are counted together. 

</p><p>One of the largest listings in both lists above is the Washington Fundamental
Catalog (WFC; Wycoff &amp; Mason 2001). These double star measures were extracted 
from the WFC, a collection of 144 astrographic and transit circle catalogs 
covering a timebase of over one hundred years and most recently used in the 
computation of proper motions for the Tycho-2 project. While not intended as a
double star reference, the utility of transit circle and photographic measures
were known early in the 20th century, and many of the doubles in the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/proj/AC/home.html">Astrographic Catalogue</a>
were previously gleaned by Barton (1926) and others. However, there remained a 
plethora of double star measures in these catalogs which have now been 
cross-referenced with the WDS to produce these totals. 

<a name="bdsadswds"></a>

</p><p><img src="wdstext_fichiers/new_tiny.html" border="0">The ADS cross-reference has now been
expanded and includes the identifier from the earlier Burnham Double Star (BDS; 
Burnham 1906) Catalogue as well as the later Aitken Double Star (ADS; Aitken 
1932) Catalogue. BDS stars falling outside a criteria, based on magnitude and
separation (and thus a likelyhood of physicality) were dropped from the ADS.
Most of these stars were added back in the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars
(IDS; Jeffers, van den Bos and Greeby 1963). Some of these stars were true binaries,
and should be added back, others were added due to concerns due to common proper
motion determinations or proximity. In the three cross-reference files below there
are sorts based on BDS number (listing all BDS entries, even those not real though
these have explanations for their removal), ADS number (again, bogus binaries carry
a reason for their removal), and WDS coordinate. As before, all components associated
with the BDS or ADS system are included even if they were not known at the time of the
publication of those catalogs. As mentioned above, duplicate and bogus systems
included in the BDS or ADS have been excised for one of the following reasons:

</p><ol>
<li>Not real. See Douglass, G.G. "The non-duplicity of 189 ADS stars,"
    1978, Bull. Inf. Centre Donnees Stellaires, 14, 11
</li><li>Not in WDS. Single according to IDS notes and also in McC1984.
</li><li>Not in WDS. In a planetary or reflection nebula.
</li><li>In a file of Charles Worley's called "horror.data." He said, "you're
    going to have to deal with this, he he he." Very questionable, or would
    not have been purged from WDS.
</li><li>In WDS, 1984.0 but excised from WDS, 1996.0. I don't know why.
    In a file of Charles Worley's called "suspect.data." I do not know 
    what the material difference is between this and "horror.data," they
    may just represent problem data done at different times.
</li><li>In WDS, 1984.0, but excised from WDS, 1996.0. Not in horror or
    suspect files. This could indicate its non-duplicity was certain.
</li><li>In BDS but excised from ADS, IDS, WDS. Double not found. Purged.
</li><li>In BDS. Removed from ADS, reinserted into IDS, removed from WDS. 
    Apparently Aitken had it right. Purged.

<p>Some detections are not included in the WDS. These include measures by long 
baseline interferometry where only visibilities and baselines are published 
(as opposed to a true separation and position angle) are not included. Also, 
various <i>1-d</i> detection data (e.g., lunar occultation and some infrared 
speckle interferometry) are not included, as the measured separation is only a 
projection of the true separation. These data are available in the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/int4.html"> 4th Catalog of Interferometric Measurements of Binary 
Stars</a> (Hartkopf, Mason, Wycoff, &amp; McAlister 2001; hereafter Speckle 
Catalog). The absence of separation and position angle information for the 
long-baseline interferometry data is perhaps most tragic as these data cannot be
readily combined with other ``classical'' double star data for a true combined 
solution.

<br><br></p><h2>Unpublished Results</h2>

<p>For a variety of reasons, there exist a large subset of measures contained in
the WDS database which have not been published. To make these data available to 
the astronomical community they are listed below. It is anticipated that this 
section will expand substantially as the data contained in the WDS are collated.

<br></p><h4><i>Nils Wieth-Knudsen measures:</i></h4> In late 2001, Inger 
Wieth-Knudsen made available to the U.S. Naval Observatory the original 
measurement cards Dr. Nils Wieth-Knudsen made towards the end of his 
distinguished career. The original cards are cataloged in the 
<a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/library/index.html">James Melville Gillis 
Library</a> of the U.S. Naval Observatory. The 471 measures recorded on these
cards are grouped into 211 means of 59 systems, and include 33 measures of 
differential magnitude. Made with both 10 and 30 inch telescopes, the 
observation dates range from 1961.32 to 1989.34 and the measured separations 
range from 0.46 to 28.97 arcseconds.

<br><h4><i>Walt Sanders measures:</i></h4> Over the past years Walt Sanders has
(and is) continuing his observing of primarily wide M dwarf stars with a filar
micrometer on the Lick 36-inch refractor. This continues the work described in
<i>The Astronomical Journal</i> (volume 71, page 1008; December 1966). As of
January 1, 2002 it consisted of 219 measures averaged into 99 means of 69 pairs,
with observation dates from 1996.32 to 1998.70 (thusfar, observations continue)
and the measured separations range from 3.2 to 122.9. In three cases no 
separation is measured, but the position angle is.

<br><h4><i>Martin Nicholson measures:</i></h4> In late 2002 Martin Nicholson began
a project of examining the Guide Star Catalog for close doubles. An explanation
of his project, written by him, is provided 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/unpublished/nicholson.html"> here</a>.

<br><h4><i><img src="wdstext_fichiers/new_tiny.html" border="0">OAG General Catalogue of 
10,000 visual double stars measurements 1970-2003 (J2000.0):</i></h4><i> Coordinated 
by Tofol Tobal and Jaume Planas. Garraf Astronomical Observatory. Barcelona-Spain

</i><p><i>In the last 40 years, a limited group of Spanish amateurs has been systematically 
measuring visual double stars. Actually, they are preparing to publish all the 
measurements made between 1970 and 2001 --- over 10,000. This massive work has been 
presented at October, 2000, in the annual meeting of the Astronomic Society of France's 
Double Stars Commission, celebrated  in Castelldefels, near Barcelona, Spain. 
(Josefina Ling, Circular UAI Commission-26 was in the meeting).

</i></p><p><i>The first measurement catalogue entirely produced in Spain by an amateur was the Jose Luis 
Comellas (Doctor of Contemporaneous History, Sevilla University) one, published in 1973 
(Catalogo de Estrellas Dobles Visuales 1973.0). It contained measurements from 1,200 double 
stars, using a simple micrometer and a 75mm aperture Polarex-Unitron refractor. Twelve years 
after, the same author published a second catalogue (Catalogo de Estrellas Dobles Visuales 
1980.0) that included 5,104 doubles within reach of his new 102mm aperture Polarex-Unitron 
refractor, with a Ron Darbinian Filar Micrometer, of which he had personally measured over 
3,500. For the quality and quantity of his publications, that included his exceptional Guia del 
Firmamento (1982) where he gathers together all his experience of more than thirty years of 
visual observation, as well for his extraordinary human condition, he is one of the most loved 
and admired authors in Spain and South America.

</i></p><p><i>Since 1985 new observers have assured the continuity of J.L. Comellas work. Since 1976, I 
regularly collaborated with him, and in the mid 80s I had a little observatory supplied with a 
102mm Polarex Unitron refractor and a filar micrometre, that enabled me to start systematic 
revision and update programs of the 1980.0 catalogue. In 1991, in conjunction with other 
colleagues, we coordinated the measurements sent to us by isolated observers, and started to 
publish a circular (RHO: Circular de Estrellas Dobles Visuales) for internal use, in order to 
coordinate our work and to make known our results. 

</i></p><p><i>Our equipment enhanced its measurement power with the purchase of new precision micrometers, 
Double Image Lyot-Chamichel-like, and CCD devices. Between 1992 and 2003 more than 5,000 
new observations and measurements has been collected, provided by Spain-wide amateurs, and 
this has allowed to arrange a new catalogue suited to the 21st Century observers needs.

</i></p><p><i>Given the huge bulk of filed data, it was necessary to develop our own database managing, 
analysis and ephemeris calculation software (MAIA). This job has been carried on by my 
colleague Jaume Planas, in collaboration with Jordi Cairol and Albert Sanchez, both members 
of OAG.

</i></p><p><i>The evolution and development of this process has been made known in the meetings of the 
Astronomic Society of France's Double Stars Commission in Lyon (1995), Nice (1996), 
Bordeaux (1997), Tolouse (1999). This has enabled the Spanish visual double stars observers 
to break a certain isolation they were suffering since some decades ago.

</i></p><p><i>Actually, the database and the different aplications it contains are for internal use only, 
but we are preparing an interactive version for  Internet. In this way, our "OAG General Catalogue 
of 10,000 visual double stars measurements 1970-2000 (J2000.0)" wll be easily available 
to any worldwide observer.

</i></p><center><i>Note about Garraf Astronomical Observatory</i></center>

<p><i>Garraf Astronomical Observatory (OAG), founded in 1991 from private and public investments, 
develops didactic and research programs. Our observatory (1992-1998) have a 3.5m diameter 
dome with a 300mm aperture Newton-Cassegrain (F/3,5 and F/13,5) reflector, and 150mm F/8 
refractor. Is  located 30km to the south of Barcelona, inside the Garraf Natural Park, 300m over 
the sea. Our observatory is fully equipped for a double stars programs, with CCD, Professional 
Double Image Lyot-Camichel Micrometer (made by MECAPRECIS-France) and various 
Micrometer Reticle Eyepiece (MEADE).

<br><br><h2>Neglected Doubles</h2>

<p>A large number of systems in the WDS may be characterized as ``neglected.''
These include unconfirmed binaries as well as systems which have not been 
resolved for many years. The reasons for this neglect are varied: poor 
coordinates or large proper motion (so the systems are ``lost''), erroneous 
magnitude or delta-m estimates (so the systems are skipped over or 
misidentified), or true neglect (too many binaries and too few observers). While
the veracity of some of these systems is certainly suspect, many (if not most) 
of these are <i>bona fide</i> double stars. Three sets of lists are provided in 
observing list format. The first set was compiled using the following selection 
parameters:

</p><ul>
<li>Separation greater than three arcseconds
</li><li>Delta-m (V band) of less than three magnitudes
</li><li>Both components brighter than 11th magnitude
</li><li>and one of three possible parameters meriting inclusion<ul>
    <li>Not observed in twenty years (an N code)
    </li><li>Unconfirmed (a C code)
    </li><li>Orbit system in the above parameter space, possibly useful for 
        calibration (a * code)
</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>A total of 6442 objects meet these criteria.

</p><ul>Neglected Doubles List Set I:
<li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/NEGLECTED/neglectednorth1.html">  Northern List (Dec &gt; +20, num = 3072)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/NEGLECTED/neglectedmiddle1.html"> Equatorial List (-20 &lt; Dec &lt; +20, num = 2331)</a>

</li></ul>

<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/NEGLECTED/finder.html">Finder Charts for List Set I</a>

<p>The second set of lists were compiled under the same criteria as above, but 
for separations under 3 arcseconds. A total of of 6632 systems fit these 
criteria.

</p><ul>Neglected Doubles List Set II:
<li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/NEGLECTED/neglectednorth2.html">  Northern List (Dec &gt; +20, num = 1860)</a>

</li><li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/NEGLECTED/neglectedsouth2.html">  Southern List (Dec &lt; -20, num = 2062)</a>
</li></ul>

<p>The third and final set of lists includes those neglected systems not covered
by the previous lists. These include systems with large magnitude differences, 
or fainter primary or secondary magnitudes, as well as systems whose magnitudes 
or separations are either unknown or unpublished. A total of 45,768 systems fit 
these criteria.

</p><ul>Neglected Doubles List Set III:

</li></ul>

<p>Set three contains thirteen doubles since excised by the Tycho team. These
have been marked on the observing lists.

<br><br><h2>Hipparcos and Tycho-2</h2>

<p>The current edition of the WDS contains the most recent, observational data 
available and includes systems newly discovered by the 
<a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/hipparcos.html">Hipparcos 
mission</a>. While Hipparcos did not provide discovery designations, these are 
the primary system identifiers in visual double star astronomy. A 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/xrefhds.html"> cross reference</a> file of these 3,406 systems 
first resolved by Hipparcos (HDS = Hipparcos Double Star) containing the 
abbreviated coordinate, as well as the HDS and HIP numbers is provided as are 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/hipprobframe.html">cross references</a> of WDS entries which had 
Hipparcos problem solutions (i.e., the G, X, O, V double star solutions as well 
as those which were suspected non-single). Systems with only one measure in the 
WDS which are Hipparcos problem stars (thus, providing a quasi-confirmation) are
indicated in the notes file.

</p><p>The current version of the WDS also contains measures of 12,770 systems from
the <a href="http://www.astro.ku.dk/%7Eerik/Tycho-2">Tycho-2 Catalogue</a>. These
include 11,536 known systems as well as 1,220 newly determined (TDS = Tycho
Double Star) systems from the Tycho-2 database. The previous total of 1,234 new 
systems, has been changed to 1,220 following retraction of some new double stars
by the Tycho team. These numbers are presented as blank lines in the TDS cross
reference file. Also, notes have been added for 1,130 systems of dubious 
veracity (N &lt; 3) having a ``failed double'' or ``photocenter'' solution. Some of
these are being reconsidered as further processing of the Tycho-2 data for 
double stars continues (Fabricius et al. 2001). A cross-reference of double 
stars measured by Tycho-2 is available <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/xreftyc2.html"> here</a>. A
cross-reference of new TDS systems is available <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/xreftds.html"> 
here</a>.

</p><p>In 2001 an effort led by Claus 
Fabricius was begun to extract from the Tycho pixel data as many double stars, 
both new and known, as possible. This effort has resulted in the 
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002A%26A...384..180F&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3c63bd902f15156">
Tycho Double Star Catalogue</a>. A total of 25,232 additional double star 
measures (in addition to those enumerated above) were found. The numbering of 
new Tycho doubles (the TDS stars) includes the original set of 1,234 
(subsequently reduced to 1,220) described above plus additional systems found in
the Tycho Double Star Catalogue reduction. This second set of new doubles begins
with TDS1235 (the retracted TDS numbers are not reused). A complication arose as
a result of the magnitude of this work --- what to do when the number is 10,000 
or more (i.e., after TDS9999, what next?). A makeshift strategy was employed by 
taking the next available designation, TDT (Tycho Doubles, too?), thus the next 
system after TDS9999 is TDT   1. The known and new doubles listings includes 
both analyses of the Tycho data. In addition, precise coordinates (better than 
arcsecond) are available for another subset of double stars seen as single by 
Tycho (due to the magnitude of the secondary and/or separation of the system). 
The improvements in the precision of the WDS is discussed below.

<br><br><h2>Other Changes in the WDS</h2>

<br><h4><i>Changes since the WDS, 2001.0:</i></h4> As the WDS is updated
nightly, distinguishing the changes that have been made is not always a trivial 
matter for the user. Output from the unix ``diff'' command (cf., GNU diffutils 
version 2.7) is given below.

<ul>Available files:
<li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/currentvs2001_summ.txt">  Summary Catalog differences</a>
</li><li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/currentvs2001_ref.txt">   Reference file differences</a>
</li><li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/currentvs2001_note.txt">  Notes file differences</a>
</li></ul>

<br><h4><i>Changes in the reference file:</i></h4> The reference file appears in
a different format than previously available. In the past, three characters 
would specify to whom the reference belonged with a two digit number indicating 
the specific reference. In the case of some observers, this was proving 
inadequate. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that the WDS, the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/orb6.html">6th Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars</a> (Hartkopf &amp;
Mason 2001; hereafter, Orbit Catalog), the <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/int4.html"> Speckle 
Catalog</a>, and the <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/dm2.html"> Second Photometric Magnitude Difference
Catalog</a> (Worley, Mason, &amp; Wycoff 2001; hereafter Delta-m Catalog) all used 
different reference codes. A new reference file is therefore provided which 
gives the new code as well as the WDS reference code, followed by the reference.
This is expected to change over time as the WDS is reformatted and the old WDS 
catalog code is replaced. The additional discoverer codes are included within 
this file. 

<br><h4><i>Changes in the data request software:</i></h4> The data request 
software has been rewritten and the output is in a new format which is 
(hopefully) more user-friendly. Also, the software now searches the Delta-m 
Catalog and the Orbit Catalog in addition to the WDS. Over time we will be 
adding other features in a data request package.

<p>In addition, we now also provide custom-made observing lists. If the user 
provides limitations as to RA, Dec, separation, magnitudes, number of 
observations, and date of last observation, it is possible to prepare observing
lists. Both data requests and observing list requests are available online.

<br><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/dm2.html"><h4><i>The Second Delta-m Catalog:</i></h4></a> New to 
the WDS is an additional indicator in columns 100-102. This ``D'' note code 
indicates the system has additional Delta-m information tabulated in the Delta-m
Catalog (in addition to those determined during astrometric measures). These 
results will eventually be incorporated in a weighted scheme for the magnitude 
listings of the WDS data line. 

<br></p><h4><i>Discovery Designations Added:</i></h4> The coordinates provided for 
entries in the WDS are neither unique nor constant, and are therefore, 
unsuitable to identify a system. Following the assignment of HDS designations to
systems first resolved by the Hipparcos satellite, an effort was made to assign 
unique discovery codes to all other systems in the WDS. In some cases, two 
different systems can have the same discovery code and number but different 
components. Therefore, to uniquely identify a system it is necessary to include 
the component field. Eight hundred twenty-two systems have had their discovery 
number assigned by the USNO in this manner and are identified in the notes file.

<br><h4><i>Systems Removed:</i></h4> Corrections have been made to many of the
Luyten duplicate designations as well as the new discoveries, since disclaimed,
of the Tycho-2 project. These and other errata are provided in an error 
correction file which is <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/wdserror.txt">available online</a>. 

<br><h4><i>Future of Designations:</i></h4> On 11 August, 2000, during the 
XXIVth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, a 
Multi-Commission Meeting (MCM) on Stellar Designations was held. The purpose of 
this meeting was to develop a simple, unambiguous, flexible, and 
computer-friendly designation scheme for all stellar companions (including 
planets). Members from nine supporting commissions participated and, as a 
result, a C type IAU Resolution was drafted and adopted by Commissions 26 and 
42, and later ratified by Commissions 5 and 8+24 at their respective business 
meetings. Subsequent to the MCM on 24 October, Commission 45 SOC members 
unanimously supported the resolution.

</li></ul>

<br><h4><i>Duplicate Discovery 
Designations Removed:</i></h4> One of the more difficult issues in dealing with 
the WDS as a database is the presence of duplicate discovery designations - that 
is, different systems assigned the same 3-character + 4-digit designation. These 
generally fall into one of two categories: systems given the same numbers but 
published in different lists, and those given some additional designation 
appended to the original one.

<p>Examples of the first are the binaries first resolved by W. Herschel and 
both F.G.W. Struve and O. Struve. William Herschel published seven lists (I - 
VI, plus ``new'', or N), with stars of each list starting at number 1. In 
addition to their original discovery lists, each of the Struve's published an 
appendix, as well as a list of ``rejected'' doubles. These multiple lists were 
completely spelled out in the Aitken Double Star Catalogue (e.g., H IV 48), 
but when the Index (IDS) Catalogue was compiled at Lick all of these other 
designators were dropped for lack of space. As a result there are, for example,
five components with the designation H    48!  The source Herschel list was 
given in the notes file to the IDS. Appended and rejected stars from the lists 
of the Struve's were handled with an ``a'' or ``r'' towards the end of the WDS
data line in most cases.

</p><p>In the second (and fortunately rare) case, systems found quite near to known 
ones were given the same designation plus trailing character(s) (e.g., ES 1293a
or BU 885 1/2).  Sometimes both components were assigned these additional 
characters, sometimes only one; occasionally two pairs in an entirely different
section of the sky were given the same designation by the author (probably by 
mistake).

</p><p>Each of these cases is being handled in a different manner. For the William
Herschel discoveries, a list identifier is added to column three of each 
designation. For example:

</p><pre>H    19 (at 16 hours) was originally H II 19 and is now known as H 2  19, 
H     7 (at 18 hours) was originally H V 7   and is now known as H 5   7, and
H   111 (at 06 hours) was originally H N 111 and is now known as H N 111.
</pre>

<p>In the case of the O. Struve appendix an A is added following STT in the 
name. For F. Struve, he provided two appendices. Those from the shorter list 
(Appendix II) are designated STFB. For example:

</p><pre>STF  11 (appendix I)  is now STFA 11.
STF  11 (appendix II) is now STFB 11.
STT 252 (appendix)    is now STTA252.
</pre>

<p>Stars of the second type are given the same 3-letter discovery designation
but a new number, starting with 9001, to indicate that they originally had a
different designation. For example:

</p><pre>BAL2356b    is now BAL9001.
BU  885 1/2 is now BU 9001.
</pre>

A complete list of stars of the second type is provided in the 
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/wdserror.txt"> error correction</a> file. All changes in 
designation are described in the <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wdsnewnotes_main.txt"> notes</a> file.
In addition to these, designations for 271 W. Herschel (H  ), 110 F. Struve 
(STF) and 227 O. Struve (STT) systems have been changed. Note that for some of 
these systems, the former three character, four digit reference (a3i4) has been
replaced by a four character, three digit reference (a4i3). Although, for all 
USNO applications (e.g., data or observing list request) an a7 read will see no 
difference.

<br><h4><i>Arcsecond Precise 
Coordinates:</i></h4> Coordinates which are sixty times more precise than the
WDS identifier are now provided for the majority of WDS systems (i.e., tenths
of a <b>second</b> of time and <b>seconds</b> of arc). Coordinates are 
obtained from Hipparcos, Tycho-2, the Tycho Double Star Catalogue, or through
manual inspection. It is expected that the next significant improvement in this
area will be when either the 2MASS or UCAC data is cross-referenced with the WDS.
Incremental changes will continue to be made as well. The ten-digit WDS identifier
is retained and will continue to be the same for all components in hierarchical
systems. However, the precise coordinate will be for the primary of the subsystem.
For example, in the case of a system made up of A-BC and BC pairs, they will both
have the same ten-digit WDS identifier, however, the fourteen digit precise
coordinate would be of the A and B component, respectively. As of 14 December 2004
arcsecond precise coordinates had been found for 92% of the systems in the WDS 
(i.e., 93,073 systems).

We give here grateful acknowledgement to all those who have assisted us in locating
these many of the hardest to find pairs: Richard Jaworski and John Greaves.

<br><h4><i>Secondary Proper 
Motion:</i></h4> The most common note (N = 1421) in the WDS notes file was the 
proper motion of the secondary, when known. The above matching with Tycho-2 has
allowed the determination of secondary proper motion for 37% of the WDS (as of
1 July 2002, matching continues; i.e., 36,042 systems). The secondary proper 
motion is found following the precise position. This is expected to grow 
considerably when the UCAC is complete.

<a name="aa"></a>

<br><h4><i>The Bright Star list (H2-H31)
of the <b>Astronomical Almanac</b>:</i></h4> Stars found in the Bright Star list
of the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i> have been cross-referenced with both the WDS
and the single star list (described below). Those which have matches with the
WDS have their most recent observables (position angle, separation, delta-m)
along with other identifiers. All known resolved components of bright stars are
listed. Stars found in the Bright Star list which match with the single star 
list are listed by HR number only. These stars are indicated as single by 

<ul>
<li>large aperture speckle which resolves down to 60 milliarcseconds for 
    components with delta-V less than 3, and
</li><li>are not Hipparcos ``problem stars'' (G, X, V, or O codes in field H59 of the
    main catalog or S code in field H61).
</li><li>Further, they are not in the WDS, which has many binaries listed not 
    detected by speckle interferometry according to the parameters listed above.
</li></ul>

<ul>Available files:
<li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/aadoubleframe.html">  Double Stars in the Bright Star list</a>
</li><li><a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/misc/aasingle.txt">        Single Stars in the Bright Star list</a>
</li></ul>

For double stars in the above list, if the last measured separation is less than
0.05 arcseconds, a separation of `&lt;0.1' is listed. If the magnitude of the 
listed component is unknown, this is reflected in the delta-m column, which is
also unknown.

<a name="single"></a>

<br><br><h2>Single Stars</h2>

<p>For observations of double stars it is often necessary and beneficial to 
observe single stars. These can serve as an idealized point-source-function 
(psf) to determine the behavior of various elements in the optical chain, 
characterize various reduction algorithms, or be used to generate artificial 
double stars or other more complicated morphologies by use of calcite crystals, 
slit masks, aperture masks, etc.

</p><p>Unfortunately, finding a good list of these calibrator sources is more 
difficult than it sounds. Generally speaking, the more that stars are studied 
the higher their multiplicity fraction. Erroneously labeled ``single stars'' can
render vital calibration data useless through the discovery of a previously 
unknown companion or the slight modification of the psf by an unresolved 
component.

</p><p>The basic data for this list come from the <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/int3.html"> Speckle 
Catalog</a>, which tabulates null detections from various duplicity surveys in 
addition to double star measures obtained by speckle interferometry and other 
high-resolution techniques. Stars from the 
<a href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Cat?V/50">Bright Star Catalog</a> 
(Hoffleit &amp; Warren 1991) are checked against the WDS, the Speckle Catalog, and 
the Hipparcos Catalog (ESA 1997) and only considered to be ``single'' stars if 
all the following criteria are met:

</p><ul>
<li>the stars show no indication of duplicity in any of the three catalogs,
</li><li>the stars have tabulated null detections in the Speckle Catalog, at least
    one of which was obtained with a telescope of 2-m or greater aperture, and
</li><li>the stars have no Hipparcos double-star solutions (C, G, X, V, or O codes
    in field H59 of the main catalog) and no S (``suspected non-single'') code
    in field H61.
</li></ul>

<p>The <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/single/singleframe.html">final all-sky list</a> contains 1,170 
systems fulfilling these criteria. In the future, it is planned to update this 
list to include systems which would be unresolved by optical interferometry.

<br><br></p><h2>The Catalog</h2>

<p>Measures in the Washington Double Star Catalog have been collected, collated,
and maintained since the early 1960's when the original IDS (Jeffers &amp; van den 
Bos, 1963) was transferred from Lick Observatory to the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
Presented in order are the WDS J2000 coordinates, the discovery and component 
designation, the first and last measured epoch, the number of means, the first 
and last measured position angle (theta) in degrees, the first and last measured
separation (rho) in arcseconds, the magnitudes of the primary and secondary, the
spectral type of one or both components (if known), proper motion in RA and Dec 
(milliarcseconds/yr), the Durchmusterung (DM) number (The DM of the 
object in the system used by the Henry Draper Catalogue: Bonn from +89 to -22
inclusive, Cordoba from -23 to -51 inclusive, Cape Photographic from -52 to -89
inclusive), and a notes column. It should be noted that the WDS is not a 
photometric or spectral type catalog, and while the catalogers strive to provide
the most correct values for these parameters, they should not be considered 
definitive. Some characters in the notes column indicate specific entries in 
another file (i.e., an N indicates an entry in the notes file), catalog (an O in
the Orbit Catalog, and a D in the Delta-m Catalog), or are referenced in the 
format file. The full Catalog (8.7Mb) is available below as are format, note, 
reference and other ancillary files. The WDS 2001.0 is also available on a 
CD-ROM of USNO double star catalogs. Copies of this CD-ROM can be obtained from 
the authors.

<h2>Requests and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Addition of the delta-m information as well as other more significant changes
to the WDS database is currently under consideration. The input from regular 
users of the database and other interested parties is greatly appreciated in our
efforts to make the WDS as helpful and user-friendly as possible. Please provide
comments on the format of the WDS, missed references, or any other items of
interest to you on our <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wds_comment.html">Comment form</a>.

</p><p>Information is being added to the database on a continuing basis, and this
edition of the WDS will also be updated regularly. 

</p><p>You may <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/data_request.html">request</a> a reasonable amount of 
information from the double star catalog, a <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/obslist_request.html">
custom observing list</a>, a <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/cd_request.html">copy of the Double Star 
CD</a>, or make a <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wds_comment.html">comment</a> by e-mail.

<p>We are in debt to <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/history/douglass.html">Geoff Douglass</a> for his 
work on the WDS database and his leadership in the speckle program at the USNO. 
The Washington Double Star Catalogs and USNO speckle program were conceived and 
nurtured by <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/history/worley.html">Charles Worley.</a> Providing data in WDS 
format (or at least electronic format) has allowed the WDS to grow 
significantly. We would here like to acknowledge the contributions of Bob 
Argyle, Wulff Heintz, Elliott Horch, Josefina Ling, Francisco Manuel Rica 
Romero, and Walt Sanders.

<br><br></p><h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>
