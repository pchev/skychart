This program convert the HST Guide Star Catalogue from the original FITS format 
CD-rom for use with "Cartes du Ciel" / "Sky Charts" program. 
You may run this utility only if you want to put the Guide Star on hard disk, otherwise 
"Sky Chart" might use the CD-rom directly. 
The GSC Compact version must be used directly by Cartes du Ciel but not by this 
program.
In the first field enter the complete directory path to the zone directory of the original 
catalogue.
In the second the individual zone to convert.
In the third field enter the path where to install the converted catalog , 
I suggest you keep the default: <Sky Chart path>\cat\gsc
For the complete catalogue you must have 480 MB free disk space on the destination 
directory but less if you convert only a few declination zones.
If you check the box "Remove multiple entries" then only the first occurence of stars 
with the "multiple" flag will be keep, this save aproximately 30% of space without 
effect on chart quality.
If you check the box "Remove non stellar objects" then all object with the "class" 
code different from 0 or 2 will be rejected, this save 15% of space but may cause the 
rejection of real stars in crowded fields.
When the two options are checked this save globaly 40% of space.
Press "Conversion" key and be patient... 
Each zone may take from five to thirty minutes to complete, depending on your 
machine. 
When it finish press "Exit" key.
