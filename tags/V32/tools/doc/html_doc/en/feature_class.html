<p>The following feature class terms consist of nine or fewer letters originally
  defined for mainframe computer search and retrieval. They do not identify all
  kinds of cultural and natural features. The terms are generally consistent
  with dictionary definitions, but represent more generalized categories. Commonly
  used generic alternatives are listed in parentheses to assist in understanding
  the range of cultural and natural entities represented by the term. <a name="airport"></a>Many
  different feature classification schemas have been designed to serve various
  systems and agencies. However, the Federal Government takes no position with
  respect to feature classification and there are no officially sanctioned lists
  or definitions. These were designed for and have proven useful to the Geographic
  Names Information System. Every feature in the database is assigned to one
  and only one feature class.</p>
