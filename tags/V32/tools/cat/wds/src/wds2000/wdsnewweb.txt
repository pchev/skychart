                          Description of Data in the WDS                         
                                                                                 
Columns   1- 10:    The  hours, minutes, and tenths of minutes of Right Ascen-
                    sion for 2000, followed by the degrees and minutes of
                    Declination for 2000, with + and - indicating north and
                    south declinations. The positions given represent our best
                    estimates of these values. Where possible, these are based
                    on the ACRS and PPM data, with proper motion incorporated.
                                                                                 
Columns  12- 18:    The discoverer, identified by his one-to-three letter code,
                    and his discoverer's number, if assigned. The reference list 
                    should be consulted first to identify individuals. However,  
                    some discoverer designations do not appear in this list, for 
                    various reasons, and a supplementary list is provided.
                                                                                 
Columns  20- 24:    Components, when the object has more than two. The Lick IDS
                    scheme has been discontinued, and components are now
                    referred to by the traditionally employed lower-case letters.
                    The rather awkward upper-case designations, e.g. ABXC, have
                    been changed to the form AB-C, etc.
                    We have noted some confusion on the part of observers and
                    students alike, as to how to designate components in multi-
                    ple systems. Traditionally, these have been designated in
                    order of separation, thus AB, AC,...., or in the cases where
                    close pairs are observed blended, AB-C, AB-D,.... In some
                    instances, differing resolution limits produce situations
                    where observations are intermixed, thus AC, AB-C, and so
                    forth. (In all too many cases, carelessness on the part of
                    the observer does not permit us to determine with certainty
                    how the observation is to be interpreted). There are also
                    many instances where later observations have revealed a
                    closer companion; these are designated Aa, Bb, etc. In a
                    few cases wider, later discoveries have also been so denoted.
         
Columns  26- 29:    The dates of the first and last observations of an object
         31- 34:    (of satisfactory accuracy), up to the closing date of 1996.0.
                                                                                 
Columns  36- 37:    The number of measures of the object. When there are more
                    than 99, the number 99 is used. For smaller numbers of
                    observations, the value in these columns is intended to
                    accurately reflect the actual number.
                                                                                 
Columns  39- 41:    Position angles in degrees for the dates listed in columns
         43- 45:    26-34. For some pairs, the discoverers have given only crude
                    estimates, such as NF or SP; in such cases these are listed. 
                    Position angles are unprecessed in this catalog (i.e. they   
                    are for the mean date of observation).                       
                                                                                 
Columns  47- 51:    The distances in seconds of arc, and tenths, for the dates
         53- 57:    listed in columns 26-34. Some separations are treated by the
                    codes found in columns 100-101, or in the Notes.
                                                                                 
                    In cases where there has been no appreciable motion observed 
                    over the duration of observation, only one position angle    
                    and separation is listed.                                    
                                                                                 
Columns  59- 63:    Magnitudes of the two components. See the Introduction for
         65- 69:    discussion.
                                                                                 
Columns  71- 79:    Spectral type of A, or of two components, if space permits.
                    See the Introduction for discussion.
                                                                                 
Columns  81- 84:    The components of the proper motion in seconds of arc per
         86- 89:    1000 years, in right ascension reduced to great circle, and
                    in declination. Specifically, this catalog lists 15mu(alpha) 
                    cos(delta), where mu(alpha) is in seconds of time, and       
                    mu(delta) is in seconds of arc. Both quantities are reduced
                    to a time unit of 1000 years. The exceptions are those ob-
                    jects coded P, Q, and R, for which an explanation is given
                    under the description for Columns 79 and 80. + and - indicate
                    eastward and westward motions in Right Ascension, and + and -
                    those north and south in Declination.
                                                                                 
Columns  91- 98:    Durchmusterung number of the object in the system used by
                    the Henry Draper Catalogue: Bonn from +89 degrees to -22
                    degrees inclusive, Cordoba from -23 degrees to -51 degrees
                    inclusive, Cape Photographic from -52 degrees to -89 de-
                    grees inclusive. When a star is not contained in the Durch-  
                    musterung proper to its declination zone, but is contained   
                    in another Durchmusterung, this is so indicated in the       
                    Notes. Other compnents having different Durchmusterung
                    numbers are also indicated in the Notes.
                                                                                 
Columns 100-102:    The following codes are contained in these columns:
                                                                                 
                        D: Delta Magnitude given.
                        N: Notes found in the Notes table.                       
                        O: Orbit. Where motion has exceeded 360 degrees, no      
                           values are listed in the position angle and sepa-     
                           ration columns. Orbits may be found in the "Fourth    
                           Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars" (Worley     
                           and Heintz, 1983), and in the Information Circulars   
                           published by Commission 26 of the IAU, as well as     
                           in the literature.                                    
                        P: 100 year proper motion in right ascension.            
                        Q: 100 year proper motion in declination.

                        a: Pair appears in an appendix list, not part of the
                           discoverer's regular numbering system.
                        p: Coordinates and proper motions from the ACRS, PPM,
                           IRS, and FK5 catalogs.
                        r: Pair was listed, but in a "rejected" list, not part
                           of the discoverer's regular numbering sequence.
                        s: Pair has other discoverer's designations and num-
                           bers in the literature due to duplicate discovery.
                           We have given credit to the earliest discovery
                           observation (and correct identification) reported
                           in the literature. The List of Synonyms follows the
                           List of Additional Discoverers.
                        6: Separation given in minutes of arc rather than
                           seconds.
