   	SAGUARO ASTRONOMY CLUB DATABASE VERSION 8.1
                   dated March 22, 2010

This compilation of data was begun in an effort to provide a comprehensive observing list for use at the eyepiece of a modest amateur telescope.  This data is released for private use of anyone who wishes to use this database. 

The members of the Saguaro Astronomy Club (pronounced sa-war-oh) of Phoenix, Arizona have provided much of the effort to compile this database.  However, it could not have been completed without the skill of a variety of people.  There is a listing of folks in the read me file who have helped with this database, thank you to all.

To align the information in this document correctly, use a non-proportional font, such as Courier.

A description of the fields and what data they contain follows:

Field Number: 1      Name: OBJECT        Size: 17
Object name, usually the NGC number is in field #1, but for objects with no NGC value the alphabetical name used is listed below.  These abbreviations are also used in field #2 as an OTHER name for some objects.

Field Number: 5      Name: R.A.          Size: 7 
Right Ascension of the object in equinox 2000.0 coordinates.  The RA is in the form  XX XX.X, such as 14 34.8 or 05 04.7.  Leading zeros are present so that a sort of the data will be numerically correct.


Field Number: 6      Name: DEC           Size: 6
Declination of the object in equinox 2000.0 coordinates.  The DEC is in the form  +/-XX XX, such as +48 10 or -88 04.  Use the sign and leading zeros.  The declination is given in degrees and minutes.


Field Number: 7      Name: MAG           Size: 4
Magnitude to nearest tenth in the form XX.X, such as 12.3.  There are many objects which have no published magnitude, they have been assigned a magnitude of 99.9.  Dark nebulae obviously have no magnitude, so we assigned them a mag of 79.9 to differentiate them from objects with no magnitude given.  The reason we chose large values for objects without magnitudes is that a sort would find 0.0 or "" as a large value of brightness. 


Field Number: 8      Name: SUBR          Size: 4
Surface brightness as given in the Reference Catalog of Galaxies 3.  Dr. Harold Corwin calculated these values of surface brightness and has supplied them to us, along with much other valuable galaxy data.


Field Number: 9      Name: U2K           Size: 3
The charts in the first release of Uranometria 2000.0 that map the area of sky in which the object is located.  It is not guaranteed that all objects plotted on U2000 are contained in the database.


Field Number: 10      Name:  TI          Size:  2
The charts in the Tirion Sky Atlas 2000.0 that map the area of sky in which the object is located.  This is included so that a less detailed view of the area will be available to star hoppers.


Field Number: 11      Name:  SIZE_MAX    Size:  8
The large dimension of the object.  A lower case "m" was used for arcminutes and a lower case "s" was used for arcseconds.  In general, only Planetary Nebulae have sizes in arcseconds.  A lower case "d" is used for degrees.


Field Number:  12     Name:  SIZE_MIN    Size:  8
The small dimension of the object.  A lower case "m" was used for arcminutes and a lower case "s" was used for arcseconds.


Field Number: 13      Name:  PA          Size:  3
The Position Angle of an elongated object.  The value is in degrees, starting with north as zero degrees and progressing clockwise from north.  So, an object which William Herschel would have described as "Elong. NE-SW" is elongated in a PA of 45 degrees.


Field Number:  14     Name: CLASS              Size:  11
Several professional classification schemes are contained here.

----Trumpler type for open clusters-----

Concentration
I.   Detached, strong concentration toward the center
II.  Detached, weak concentration toward the center
III. Detached, no concentration toward the center
IV.  Not well detached from surrounding star field

Range in brightness
1.  Small range        2.  Moderate range       3.  Large range

Richness
p  Poor (<50 stars)
m  Moderately rich (50-100 stars)
r  Rich (>100 stars)

An "n" following the Trumpler type denotes nebulosity in cluster

Note:  the type descriptions from the source used also contained references to other scientific papers.
These notes are seen as either ":a" or ":b" at the end of the Trumpler types.  For visual purposes
they can be ignored.

----Shapley-Sawyer concentration rating for globular clusters---

The values range from 1 to 12, smaller numbers are more
concentrated clusters.

----Vorontsov-Velyaminov type for planetary nebulae-----

1.  Stellar
2.  Smooth disk (a, brighter center; b, uniform brightness;
                 c, traces of ring structure)
3.  Irregular disk (a, very irregular brightness distribution;
                    b, traces of ring structure)
4.  Ring structure
5.  Irregular form similar to diffuse nebula
6.  Anomalous form, no regular structure

Some very complex forms may combine two types.

-----Hubble type for galaxies-----

E  elliptical, E0 is roundest to E7 is flattest
   subgroups; 'd'is dwarf, 'c'is supergiant, 'D' has diffuse halo
S  Spiral, 'a' has tightly wound arms, 'b' has moderately wound
   arms and 'c' has loosely wound arms
SB Spiral with central bar
Ir Irregular


Field Number:  15     Name:  NSTS         Size:  4
Number of stars within a cluster from a study of POSS plates by R. Lynga.


Field Number:  16     Name:  BRSTR        Size:  5
Magnitude of brightest star in cluster or central star of planetary nebula.  Much of this information is from Brian Skiff at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.


Field Number:  17     Name:  BCHM         Size:  4
Catalogs that include this object.  There are four catalogs included in this field. B=Best of the NGC from SAC, C=Caldwell catalog from Patrick Moore, H=Herschel 400 from Astronomical League, M=Messier object.  The letters for each catalog are aligned under their respective letter abbreviation.  Some objects do appear in several catalogs and therefore have several entries.


Field Number:  18     Name:  NGC_DESCR    Size:  55

Visual description of the object.  Most of these are from the NGC, some are from prominent amateurs.  Back issues of Deep Sky Magazine, Astronomy magazine, Sky and Telescope magazine and Burnham's Celestial Handbook are used as a source of some of these descriptions.  The descriptions use the abbreviations from the original NGC and Burnham's.
There are some observations by Steve Coe, they use these abbreviations:

If you have never dealt with the NGC abbreviations before, perhaps a few examples will help.

Field Number:  19     Name:  NOTES        Size:  86
Some of this field notes provided by Jim Lucyk.  Much of the rest of this information is from a variety of sources.  Most of the abbreviations used by the NGC apply here also.  Several other common names are included in these notes, so you may search for the "Owl Nebula" in this column.  There are some other names listed in this field. If there is a PA in the NOTES that is providing a companion objects' angle in relation to the main object.  Another abbreviation that is used often is P w N ( paired with NGC ###) or P w U ( paired with UGC ###).  Most of the data on companions to an object have been marked to make recognition easier, but some did not fit into the 60 spaces we alloted.  So, the data is always in this order:  distance in minutes from main object, PA from main object, then size and mag of companion. Example: P w N4566 @ 4.5,120,0.9X0.7 says that the main object is paired with NGC 4566 and is at 4.5 arcminutes distance, in a direction of PA 120 degrees (ESE) and 0.9'X0.7'in size.
