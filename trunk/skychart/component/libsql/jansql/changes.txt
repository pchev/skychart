Changes

1.2
JanSQL has some remarkable simularities with libsql, like multiple result sets. However, they have no unique handle, but are indexed. This leads to issues when deleting a result set.
also there seems lack of some kind of cursor. but hej, since it is open source and nat actively maintained afaics, i feel free to hack a little here and there to the code.
Library seems also some buggy, bad sql statements may well end up in an AV.

Pos and cons of JanSQL
Cons:
* Do not use on large datasets
* Non-standard sql syntax
* Semicolumn is disallowed character in data

Pros:
* Very suitable for small in-application databases
* Support for relative complex queries (jeining tables etc)
* Mozilla 1.1 license allows you pretty much what to do with it, as lang as you p,oint to source (of the sibrary) and some credits.
* Very usable if you accept limitations of sql `dialect` and non-indexed databases
* Flat file format more-or-less compatible with csv files.




1.1
Added Rollback support
Modified "delete from" statement to be more ansi compliant (i.e. "delete from tablename" deletes all records from the table).
