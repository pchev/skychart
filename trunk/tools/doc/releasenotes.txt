Version 3.9 beta release Notes

New functions:

  * Add the capability to display a picture for the horizon panorama. The image must be a PNG or BMP file of any size representing the full 360Â° panorama with an equirectangular projection. The horizon must be exactly at the middle height of the picture. The sky area must be set transparent (#FF00FF for BMP). The left side of the picture is the East direction. If you use another orientation you must also give the offset angle.
  * VO SAMP interoperability, allow to send and receive position click, FITS images, VO tables, VO tables row selections from other application like Aladin or Topcat.
  * Add support for JPL DE430 and DE431, you can now display the planet location between 13000BC and 17000AD.
  * New computation for the planetary satellites, add Phoebe, Triton, Nereid, Charon and 33 faint satellites.
  * Color option for Catgen nebula catalog.
  * Update URL option for Catgen text catalog.
