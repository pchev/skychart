Version 3.7 release Notes

Major changes:
  Change of the catalog index format, an index record was previously pointing directly
  to the RA,DEC coordinates. Now the index point to a catalog record.
  This allow to process the stars proper motion for a correct location at any epoch.
  This also help to display the object label and full detail even if it is not visible with
  the current chart setting.
  Because of this change you need to reinstall the stars and dso additional catalog from:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/skychart/files/0-beta/catalog/
  This also upgrade the WDS, GCVS, PGC catalog to the latest 2012 version.
  If you make you own catalog with Catgen you can rebuild your catalog to take advantage of 
  the change but the old index still work as before.

  - Rotate the label of the planet simulation perpendicular to the orbit.
