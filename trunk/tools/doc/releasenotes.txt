  - Star parallax
  - Take account of the radial velocity to compute the proper motions.
  - Light deflection by the Sun.

- Extend the allowed date to +/- 200'000 years
- Compute the precession using "New precession expressions, valid for long time intervals, J. Vondrak, 2011"
- Compute DeltaT values from "Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses, Espenak & Meeus, 2006"
- Add Tirion constellation figures created by James Trogolo
