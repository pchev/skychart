NAME

     strftime - format date and time

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <time.h>

     size_t strftime(buf, maxsize, format, timeptr)
     char *buf;
     size_t maxsize;
     const char *format;
     const struct tm *timeptr

     cc ... -ltz

DESCRIPTION
     The strftime function formats the information from timeptr
     into the buffer buf according to the string pointed to by
     format.

     The format string consists of zero or more conversion
     specifications and ordinary characters.  All ordinary
     characters are copied directly into the buffer.  A
     conversion specification consists of a percent sign and one
     other character.

     No more than maxsize characters are be placed into the
     array.  If the total number of resulting characters,
     including the terminating null character, is not more than
     maxsize, strftime returns the number of characters in the
     array, not counting the terminating null.  Otherwise, zero
     is returned.

     Each conversion specification is replaced by the characters
     as follows which are then copied into the buffer.
