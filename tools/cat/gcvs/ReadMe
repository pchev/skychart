Abstract:
    Work aimed at compiling detailed catalogs of variable stars in the
    Galaxy, which has been carried out continuously by Moscow
    variable-star researchers since 1946 on behalf of the International
    Astronomical Union, has entered the stage of the publication of the
    5th, completely electronic edition of the General Catalogue of
    Variable Stars (GCVS). This paper describes the requirements for the
    contents of the 5th edition and the current state of the catalog in
    its new version, GCVS 5.1. The complete revision of information for
    variable stars in the constellation Carina and the compilation of the
    81st Name-list of Variable Stars are considered as examples of work on
    the 5th edition. The GCVS 5.1 is freely accessible on the Internet. We
    recommend the present paper as a unified reference to the 5th edition
    of the GCVS.

Description:
    The GCVS is the only reference source on all known variable stars.
    This version contains the electronically-readable version as
    distributed by the Sternberg Astronomical Institute and Institute of
    Astronomy (Russian Acad.Sci.), Moscow. It includes the catalog of
    variable stars, updated and completed with the Name-Lists of Variables
    Stars Nos. 67-79, the NSV (New catalog of Suspected Variable stars)
    and Supplement to the NSV stars, and a catalog of extragalactic
    variables. A cross-index makes possible to find out identifications
    between the GCVS and the NSV catalogue.

    After the publication of Volume III of the 4th edition of the GCVS,
    the subsequent Name-lists with numbers from 67 to 77 contained only
    names of variable stars in the GCVS systems, together with their
    coordinates and variability types. We actually started compiling the
    5th edition of the GCVS ten years ago, with the 78th Name-list of
    Variable Stars, which provided (as did all subsequent Name-lists)
    complete GCVS information for each star (in addition to the
    variability types, ranges of brightness variations, epochs of
    brightness maxima or minima, periods, etc.). In all, the 78th-81st
    Name-lists contain more than 13300 variable stars. The complete
    revision of information on the coordinates of variable stars (see
    Introduction) was also a part of the transition to the 5th edition.

    The pesent improved electronic version of the GCVS5, combined with
    Name-Lists of Variable Stars Nos. 67-81 and NSV catalogue and
    supplement is also available from Sternberg Institute of Moscow
    University, or http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/gcvs/

    The GCVS 5.1 version contains data for 52011 individual variable
    objects discovered and named as variable stars by 2015 and located
    mainly in the Milky Way galaxy. Also, there are 158 objects that are
    non-existing, non-stellar, or stars erroneously named for the second
    time. The stars of the GCVS 5.1 are stars of the GCVS fourth edition
    plus Name-lists Nos. 67-81. The stars from the Name-lists
    Nos. 78-81 are presented in the complete GCVS format. Complete
    information for stars of the Name-lists Nos. 67-77 is so far
    provided in the first 18 constellations (Andromeda Cassiopeia). In
    these constellations, the GCVS information has been completely revised
    with active use of new publications as well as observations retrieved
    by the GCVS compilers by data mining and used to determine new
    variability types and new light elements whenever possible. We
    continue this work and will introduce new data for the next
    constellations as soon as they are ready. Upon recommendations of the
    IAU Commissions 27 and 42, in 2006, we developed a new experimental
    system of classification for variable stars.

    gcvs_cat.dat is the combined computer-readable version of the GCVS4.2
    Vols. I-III (Kholopov et al. 1985-1988) and Name-Lists of Variable
    Stars Nos. 67-81 published in the system introduced during the
    preparation of the 5th GCVS edition; the stars are arranged in the
    order of their names inside constellations. The total number of
    designated variable stars has now reached 52011. Errors detected in
    the printed Volumes I-III and in the Name-Lists were corrected; the
    file includes also improved positional information, light elements,
    classifications etc.
    For 51606 variable stars, our version provides new equatorial J2000.0
    coordinates (right ascensions to within 0.01s and declinations to
    within 0.1"), for 23934 stars with allowance for their proper motions.

    crossid.dat is the cross-identification tables of the General
    Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS) contain all GCVS (including
    variables from the Catalogue of Extragalactic Variable stars), NSV
    (New Catalogue of Suspected Variable stars) and Supplement to the NSV
    stars as well as stars from the name-lists of variable stars nos. 67 -
    81; it also makes it possible to find out identifications between the
    GCVS and the NSV catalogue.

    The final, Volume V (extragalactic variable stars) contains 10979
    variable stars in 35 stellar systems (including the Magellanic Clouds,
    the large galaxies in Andromeda and Triangulum, etc., see evs*.dat).

Note (1): designations of components of double/multiple stars:
   A,B; 1,2,3  ... (tau 1). Usually only one component of the binary
   is variable, but there exist two cases (CE Cas A,B; EQ Peg A,B) when
   both components are variable and enter the catalogue as separate lines.

Note (2): traditional transliterations of greek letters
  are used. Lower- and upper-case latin letters must be distinguished
  (e.g. u Her and U Her).

Note (6): the following codes are used (see also note on Epoch):
  ":" are used if the epoch is uncertain
  "+" epoch may be later than that reported
  "-" epoch may be earlier than that reported.

Note (7): the following codes are used:
  ">" or"<" if period is a lower or upper limit, respectively
  "(": the period is the mean cycle time of a U Gem or recurrent nova
  (in this case, there is ")" in pos. 129).

Note (8): the following codes are used:
  "*N" if the period may be a multiple of the quoted value
  "/N" if the period may be a fraction of the quoted value
  ")" - see the note on l_Period.

Note (12): "=" in byte 169 appears in two cases.
  First, it is used if the variable is equivalent to another cataloged
  variable. In such case, after the "=" symbol, the alternative name
  of the variable follows, and all necessary information on the star is
  to be found under that alternative name.
  Second, the "=" symbol may be followed by the star's
    name in the  Catalogue of Extragalactic Variable stars, evs_cat.dat

Note (13): Epoch of the given coordinates.  No epoch is provided when using the
 coordinates from the literature if the epoch was no specified in the
 publication and cold not be established;

Note (14): The variable star's identification with the source catalog is
  uncertain.

Note (15): A brief designation of the source of astrometric data.
  In several cases, the catalog designation is folowed
 by the symbol "+pm"; it implies that the position for a certain epoch
 was taken from the catalog and reduced to the epoch 2000.0 using
 information on the star's proper motion from a different source.

Note (16): Upon recommendations of the IAU Commissions 27 and 42, in 2006,
  we developed a new experimental system of classification for variable stars.

Note (17): The repetition of the GCVS name.
  Below, we give a list of the major catalogs and other data sources used,
  roghly in the order of our preference in identifying variable stars
  (see also the description of the catalogs provided for A.A. Volchkov's
  visualization code we used at www.simfov.ru).
  Hip - The Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997).
  Tyc2 - The Tycho Catalogue (Hog et al. 2000).  In isolated instances
  where the star is absent in the second Tycho catalogue but is present in
  the first catalogue (ESA 1997), the source is indicated as Tyc1.
  UCAC2 - US Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (Zacharias et al.,
  2004).
  PPM - The Positions and Proper Motions (Roser et al. 1991-1993).
  NPM - The Lick Northern Proper Motion Program (Klemola et al. 1987).
  AC - The Four-Million Star Catalog (see Gulyaev and Nesterov 1992).
  ACT - The ACT Reference Catalog (Urban et al. 1997).
  GSC 2.2 - The Guide Star Catalog, Version 2.2.01, 2001, Space Telescope
  Science, Institute and Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino.
  GSC - The Guide Star Catalog (Lasker et al. 1990).  The symbol "ns"
  accompanying a GSC reference implies that the entry is marked as a
  nonstellar object in the cited catalog.
  A2.0, B1.0 - A Catalog of Astrometric Standards (Monet et
  al., 1998) (there were rare cases when the star could be found only in the
  previous version of the catalogue, marked as A1.0); The Whole-Sky USNO-B1.0
  Catalog of 1 045 913 669 Sources (Monet et al., 2003).
  2MASS - The Two Micron All Sky Survey (Cutri et al., 2003).
  GCVS  - For some 10 stars, the coordinates were measured by the authors using
  Digitized Sky Survey images, plates from different collections, or other
  images.
  Lit. - The coordinates taken from current astronomical periodicals.

  There are several data fields that can contain asterisks.  These signify
  that more complete information will be found in the remarks to the
  published catalog.  The remarks are, unfortunately, not machine
  readable, but they do contain much supplemental information.  There, one
  will find information covering situations like, e.g.:
   1. The discoverer of the light variability is not the author of the
     paper cited in the variability reference, or is one of several authors
     of the paper cited.  In these cases, discoverers' names are given
     in original transcriptions of the remarks.
   2. The most important additional information about a star, although the
     NSV compilers did not intend to present complete bibliographies for any
     cataloged stars.
   3. Remarks for visual binaries (in parentheses following the number of a
     star in the corresponding catalog) giving visual magnitudes for the
     individual components A and B, angular separations, and position angles
     for faint components (or semimajor axis of a relative orbit and period
     of orbital motion).  Data for other components are then given where
     applicable.  (Combined magnitudes are generally reported in the
     machine-readable table.)

Note (3): type of variability (see file vartype.txt).
  The system of variable star classification corresponds to the GCVS4,
  with six additions (ZZO, AM, R, BE, LBV, BLBOO) introduced in the
  Name-Lists 67- 72 and in the GCVS vol.V.

Note (4): The star's magnitude in minimum and maximum brightness.
  Instead of the magnitude in minimum, the star's amplitude of variation may
  be indicated (in brackets).  Magnitudes are reported to hundredths if the
  observations are photoelectric or CCD, to tenths or whole magnitudes if they
  are not.  If only an amplitude has been measured photoelectrically, then
  the maximum magnitude is generally given to tenths only and the minimum
  is reported to hundredths.

Note (8): The identification of the suspected variable in the
  paper referenced above.  DM numbers are given without a prefix, the
  standard naming convention of "The Henry Draper Catalogue" being used
  (BD for zones +89 to -22; CD for -23 to -51; CP for -52 to -89).
  Some identifications are given by coordinate designations, a 6-digit
  number consisting of hours, minutes, and seconds (or tenths of a minute)
  of time and degrees of declination with sign included.  An asterisk (*)
  signifies that a designation is given in the remarks to the published
  catalog.
  Stars are sometimes designated with numbers from the catalogs of Zinner
  (ZI, 1929) and Prager (PR, 1934, 1937) because the original discovery
  publications were not available to the NSV compilers.  The catalogs of
  Zinner and Prager give detailed references to early observations of such
  stars.

Note (9): For NSV, Spectral types and subtypes only are given.
  Most luminosity classes are III to V, but if a star is a supergiant,
  more detailed classification information is given in the remarks to the
  published catalog.  The following symbols are used:
                  AF     A-F
                  AM     Am
                  AP     Ap

                  PD     Pd
                  T      characteristics of T Tauri stars
  For NSVS, Spectral types, subtypes and luminosity classes are given.
  More detailed classification information is given in the remarks to the
  catalog.
  Also the following symbols are used:
                  AF       A-F
                  cont     continuum
                  e        emission spectrum
                  ea       e sub alpha
                  FG       F-G

Note (1): Number of the variable star.
    This numbering system is made of a 3-digit number identifying the
    galaxy, followed by a 4-digit number identifying the variable in the
    galaxy. The numbering system for galaxies begins with 089, the first
    88 codes being reserved for constellations (cf. column "VarNum" in
    file "gcvs_cat.dat")

    If in the literature for the considered galaxy there exist several
    different variable star numbering systems, we have introduced new
    numbers in the order of increasing right ascension for the equinox
    1950.0. But if the variable star numbering system for the galaxy is
    practically of general use, we have retained it - if necessary, with
    additional numbers ordered by increasing right ascension.

Note (3): Variable star Designation.
    The name of the variable in the adopted system of variable star
    designations: name of the galaxy + "V" + variable star No. within the
    galaxy (see column VarNo)

Note (4):
    If there exist several spectral type determinations for a star, we
    preferred more recent ones, taking into account reliability of each
    determination. We converted symbols "d" (dwarfs) and "g" (giants) into
    luminosity classes V and III. If a nova showed spectral features
    typical of novae during or after the outburst, a symbol (NOVA) is
    given in this column. If the spectrum shows features characteristic of
    U Gem variables, this column contains the symbol (UG). Continuous
    spectrum is designated "cont", the symbol "e" means emission spectrum,
    lower case letters "ea", "eb" in this column stand for "e alpha", "e
    beta". For RR Lyrae stars, spectral types from hydrogen lines are
    given. A plus sign (+) between two spectral type values means that
    spectra of two components of a spectroscopic binary are observed. Two
    spectral type values separated with a minus sign (-) mean the range of
    spectral type variations in the process of brightness changes.

Note (5):
    Symbols "n" or "n:" for "nonmembers" or "possible nonmembers" of the
    galaxy in question. For the stars that enter the GCVS vols. I-III
    (file gcvs_cat.dat) or the NSV catalogue (file "nsv_cat.dat") and are
    not members of the corresponding galaxy, the present volume gives only
    the running number, coordinates, the symbol "n", and the GCVS or NSV
    name.

Global Notes:

Note (G1):
   the position is not listed when the variable is equivalent to another
   catalogued variable ("=" in column Exists, byte 168).

Note (G2):
  (:) a flag indicating that the coordinates are actually rougher than
  the accuracy standard adopted in the this table.
  The actual accuracy of coordinates is indicated with the symbols:
  (:) means right ascensions accurate to one second of time and
      declinations accurate to one tenth of an arcminute;
  (*) means declinations accurate to one arcminute.

Note (G3):
  The symbols are:
  ">" to indicate a faint limit
  "<" to indicate a bright limit
  "(" to indicate a that the value represents an amplitude

Note (G4):
  Code for photometric system.
  Field is non-blank if magMin is a magnitude or amplitude given in a
  system other than that indicated by magCode.
  The main codes are p (or P, PH, pg) (photographic magnitudes) and
  V (visual, photovisual, or Johnson's V).
  Several stars from the 68th Name-List have in these positions
  "1." designating the 1.04 {mu}m band of the
  system introduced by G.W.Lockwood. The designations u,v,b,y refer to
  the Stroemgren system. The symbols "Ic" and "Rc" mean magnitudes in
  Cousins' I system. "g" designates magnitudes in the system of Thuan
  and Gunn; "T" stands for broad-band Tycho magnitudes formed from B and
  V measurements; "r" are red magnitudes not tied to a particular
  system. An asterisk "*" in the corresponding position means a measurement
  in white light.
  The designations u, v, b, y refer to the Stroemgren system.  The symbols
  Ic, Rc mean magnitudes in Cousins' I, R system; Hp, T - in Hipparcos
  and Tycho mission systems; J, H, K, L, M - infrared magnitudes.
  G - Gaia magnitude
  u', g' r' i' - SDSS photmetric system

  See also the documents by Kholopov et al. (1985-1988) or Warren (1988).

Note (G5):
  Epochs are given for minimum light for all eclipsing and ellipsoidal
  variables, as well as for RV Tau and RS CVn types, and for maximum for
  all other types.  This rule may occasionally be broken, but this is
  explained only in the remarks to the catalog, which are not available
  in machine-readable form at this time.
  The epochs are Julian dates, with the starting figures 24... omitted;
  The only exception is WY Sge, where the complete epoch is JD 237249:.
  The codes ":" are used if the epoch is uncertain.

Note (G6):
    (M-m) or (D) values help to define the shape of the light curve,
    expressed as a percentage of the period of the variable:
    -- duration of the eclipse (D) for eclipsing binaries;
    -- duration of the rising time (m-M) for intrinsic variables.
    An asterisk (*) in the column "n_M-m/D" means, for an eclipsing
    variable, that the duration of the constant brightness phase in
    minimum (d) for this star is equal to zero.
    A colon (:) denotes a poor precision.

Note (G7):
   All references are detailed in the file "refs.dat".References:
  "00001" - if the main characteristics of the star were determined by
            the authors themselves.
  "00002" - "10204" -   GCVS 4.2

  If no chart is available for the variable, but the star is contained in
  one of the Durchmusterung catalogs or the Hubble Space Telescope Guide
  Star Catalog, the corresponding abbreviation
   (BD, CPD, CoD, GSC, HIP, USNO, 2MASS, UCAC2) is given.

Note (G8): an alternative name may contain:
  * a GCVS name (file "gcvs_dat.dat")
  * a "Name-list" number if it starts by the two-digit number 67 to 77,
    and is followed by the four-digit number of the star in the
    corresponding Name-list.
  * the designation of an extragalactic variable (GCVS Vol. V, see file
    "evs_cat.dat"). The name may be followed by an asterisk (*) which
    means the presence of remarks in Vol. V.
